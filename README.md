## Project Overview
Version 1
This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior towards an energy drink recently launched by codeX, a German beverage company, in 10 major cities across India. The dataset, provided by Code Basic, includes responses from 10,000 participants, capturing their preferences, perceptions, and purchasing behavior related to the energy drink.

The dataset comprises two dimension tables (dim_respondents, dim_cities) and one fact table (fact_survey_responses). The dim_respondents table records individual respondent details such as age, gender, and city of residence. The dim_cities table categorizes cities based on their tier, while the fact_survey_responses table captures various aspects of consumer behavior, including consumption patterns, brand perception, purchase preferences, etc...

This project aimed to derive actionable insights that could guide codeX's marketing strategy, product development, and market positioning efforts in the Indian market. The analysis focused on identifying key factors influencing consumer preferences, uncovering barriers to trial, and exploring opportunities for brand differentiation and packaging innovation.


## Tools & Methodologies
This project was executed in two versions, I employed two distinct toolsets to analyze the dataset and generate actionable insights comprehensively in this project.

**Version 1: Excel**
**Data Profiling & Exploration:** Excel was employed for initial data exploration, enabling quick identification of data quality issues, such as missing values and outliers. This step ensured a clear understanding of the dataset before further analysis.
**Data Pre-processing:** Using Power Query and Excel's robust set of functions, the data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. This involved handling inconsistencies, replacing values, converting values such as data decoding (converting quantitative to categorical transformation), and mapping.
