## Project Overview
Version 1
This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior towards an energy drink recently launched by codeX, a German beverage company, in 10 major cities across India. The dataset, provided by code basic, includes responses from 10,000 participants, capturing their preferences, perceptions, and purchasing behavior related to the energy drink.

The dataset comprises three tables: two dimension tables (dim_respondents, dim_cities) and one fact table (fact_survey_responses). The dim_respondents table records individual respondent details such as age, gender, and city of residence. The dim_cities table categorizes cities based on their tier, while the fact_survey_responses table captured various aspects of consumer behavior, including consumption patterns, brand perception, and purchase preferences, etc..

The objective of this project was to derive actionable insights that could guide codeX's marketing strategy, product development, and market positioning efforts in the Indian market. The analysis focused on identifying key factors influencing consumer preferences, uncovering barriers to trial, and exploring opportunities for brand differentiation and packaging innovation.
