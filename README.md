## Project Overview
Version 1
This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior towards an energy drink recently launched by codeX, a German beverage company, in 10 major cities across India. The dataset, provided by code basic, includes responses from 10,000 participants, capturing their preferences, perceptions, and purchasing behavior related to the energy drink.

The dataset comprises three tables: two dimension tables (dim_respondents, dim_cities) and one fact table (fact_survey_responses). The dim_respondents table records individual respondent details such as age, gender, and city of residence. The dim_cities table categorizes cities based on their tier, while the fact_survey_responses table captured various aspects of consumer behavior, including consumption patterns, brand perception, and purchase preferences, etc..

The objective of this project was to derive actionable insights that could guide codeX's marketing strategy, product development, and market positioning efforts in the Indian market. The analysis focused on identifying key factors influencing consumer preferences, uncovering barriers to trial, and exploring opportunities for brand differentiation and packaging innovation.


## Tools
This project was executed in two versions, I employed two distinct toolsets to analyze the dataset and generate actionable insights comprehensively in this project.

**Version 1: Excel**
Data Profiling & Exploration: Excel was employed for initial data exploration, enabling quick identification of data quality issues, such as missing values and outliers. This step ensured a clear understanding of the dataset before further analysis.


Data Inspection & Profiling: Utilized Excel's data management features to inspect the dataset, identify missing values, and assess data quality.
Pre-processing: Performed data cleaning, transformation, and normalization to prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used pivot tables, charts, and other Excel functionalities to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Analysis & Interpretation: Conducted statistical analysis to derive insights from the survey data, focusing on key consumer behavior metrics.
Interactive Reporting: Developed an interactive report using Excel's features, enabling dynamic filtering and visualization of the insights derived from the dataset.

Data Exploration & Profiling: Excel was used to conduct an initial examination of the dataset, providing a quick and intuitive way to assess data quality, identify missing values, and perform basic statistical analysis.
Data Cleaning & Pre-processing: Leveraged Excel’s powerful functions and formulas to clean, transform, and normalize the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency throughout the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting to uncover patterns and trends in the data, allowing for a deep dive into consumer behavior and preferences.
Interactive Reporting: Created dynamic reports that enabled stakeholders to interact with the data, filter results, and visualize key insights directly within Excel.

Data Profiling & Exploration: Excel was employed for initial data exploration, enabling quick identification of data quality issues, such as missing values and outliers. This step ensured a clear understanding of the dataset before further analysis.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Using Excel’s robust set of functions, the data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. This involved normalizing data, handling inconsistencies, and structuring the dataset for meaningful insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, key patterns and trends were identified, providing a deep dive into consumer behavior metrics.
Reporting & Visualization: Interactive reports were created within Excel, offering dynamic data filtering and visualization options. These reports enabled stakeholders to engage with the data and derive insights directly from the visualizations.
